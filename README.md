_Tests for D3 usages_

_Created by alicezou_


The official website for d3 is https://d3js.org/.
You can find many examples on https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery.

However, I still find D3 has limited documentations and needs lots of trials and errors.

The examples in this repo is for D3v4.

Many examples from the internet are for d3v3. D3v4 and D3v3 have many differences, and you cannot simply copy and paste to use code from v3 to v4.


The name for testing javascript and testing html are the same.

Have fun. :)
